## Overview 
### The Challenge
For Challenge 1, we were given an HTML file and a CSS file, both overcrowded and faulty. My job was to refactor the given code to make it "dry" and easier to understand. 

### Acceptance Criteria 
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code

THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the image elements

THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes

THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element

THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## My Process
### Built with:
Semantic HTML 

CSS

### What I learned: 
My biggest stuggle was learning the difference between classes and id's. I thought I already knew the difference but seeing how this specific file was set up with classes and id's, it made it hard to unlearn the wrong information I had about the two. After playing around with the code, deleting and adding, I realized that classes aren't as broad as I thought just as id's aren't as limited. 

### Continued Developement:
For future projects, I'll be sure to start by understanding the html as a whole rather than in sections. For this project, I didn't take the time to fully understand the html which, in turn, made it hard for me to notice repetitive sections.
